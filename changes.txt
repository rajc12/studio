# UnoSync Application Change Log

This file logs the major updates and fixes applied to the UnoSync application.

## 1. Initial Multiplayer Implementation
- Removed the original AI opponent.
- Integrated Firebase for backend services.
- Replaced Firestore with Firebase Realtime Database for data storage and synchronization.
- Implemented a lobby system with room codes for players to create and join games.
- Added anonymous authentication to identify unique players.
- Modified game logic to support multiple human players in real-time.

## 2. Bug Fix: Lobby Game Start
- Corrected an issue where the game would get stuck on the "Waiting for Players" screen.
- Adjusted the game start logic in the `useUnoGame` hook to correctly trigger when the minimum number of players join, ensuring the host initiates the game.

## 3. Bug Fix: Game Over Crash
- Fixed a TypeError that occurred when a player played their last card.
- The issue was caused by the player's hand data being removed from the game state upon winning.
- Updated the game logic to preserve the `players` array in the final game state to prevent crashes on the game over screen.

## 4. Feature: Draw or Dare
- Implemented a "Draw or Dare" choice when a `+2` or `+4` card is played.
- Created a new `DrawOrDareDialog` component to present the choice to the player.
- Updated the game state to include a `pendingAction` to manage this new game mechanic.
- Modified the core game logic to pause for the player's decision and handle the outcome of their choice (either drawing cards or taking a "dare").
